        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Meat and Fish</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash and season the assorted meat with salt, seasoning cubes, and some chopped onions (optional).</li>
                <li>Boil until tender. If using tough meats like cow skin or stockfish, pre-soak the stockfish and add it early during the cooking process.</li>
                <li>Add the dry fish towards the end of the cooking to prevent it from disintegrating.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Cocoyam</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil the cocoyam corms until soft, peel, and pound to a smooth paste using a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, mix cocoyam flour with a little water to form a smooth paste.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Wash the Bitter leaves</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If using fresh bitter leaves, wash them thoroughly to reduce the bitterness. This can be done by rubbing them between your palms in water, changing the water several times until the desired level of bitterness is achieved. Alternatively, you can use already washed and dried bitter leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cook the soup</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, add water or the meat stock (if any) and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the palm oil and allow it to melt into the water.</li>
                <li>Add the pounded cocoyam paste in small lumps or add the mixed cocoyam flour paste. Stir occasionally to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
                <li>Allow the cocoyam to dissolve and thicken the soup. This should take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add Seasoning and Vegetables</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the ground crayfish, seasoning cubes, pepper, and ogiri Igbo (if using). Stir well.</li>
                <li>Add the washed bitter leaves. Stir and allow to cook for about 10 minutes. Adjust the thickness of the soup with water if it is too thick.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional seasoning cubes if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Finalize the Soup</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the assorted meat and fish into the soup.</li>
                <li>Let it simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes, ensuring all the flavors meld together.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Serve hot with pounded yam, fufu, eba, or any other preferred swallow.</li>
