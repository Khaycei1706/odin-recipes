        <h1>Boiled Yam with Fried Eggs</h1>
        <p>Nigerian yam and fried eggs is a popular and simple dish enjoyed in Nigeria. It consists of boiled yam served with fried eggs.</p>
        <p>The yam is usually boiled until tender, then sliced into pieces and fried or served alongside fried eggs, seasoned with salt and pepper. 
        It's a delicious and filling meal often eaten for breakfast, brunch, or as a quick snack.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium-sized yam</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: sliced tomatoes, onions, and peppers for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the yam and cut it into thick slices or cubes, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Rinse the yam slices or cubes under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.</li>
            <li>Place the yam pieces in a pot of water and bring to a boil. Cook until the yam is tender but still firm, about 10-15 minutes. Drain the yam and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the yam is cooking, crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them lightly with a fork or whisk. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully add the yam slices or cubes to the pan in a single layer. Fry until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. This may take about 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the size of the yam pieces.</li>
            <li>Once the yam is cooked to your desired level of crispiness, remove them from the pan and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed, then pour in the beaten eggs. Cook until the eggs are set and golden brown on the bottom, then flip them over and cook for another minute or so until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried eggs from the pan and serve alongside the fried yam.</li>
            <li>Optionally, you can garnish the dish with sliced tomatoes, onions, and peppers for added flavor and freshness.</li>
            <li>Serve the Nigerian yam and fried eggs hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This dish is simple yet delicious, perfect for any time of day!</p>
