            <li>2 ripe plantains, peeled and sliced diagonally</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chicken Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken thighs or drumsticks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by marinating the chicken. In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with vegetable oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet or pot, add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, and saut√© until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the blended or finely chopped red and green bell peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste, diced tomatoes or blended fresh tomatoes, and cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth or water, thyme, curry powder, paprika, dried or fresh thyme, salt, and pepper. If using scotch bonnet pepper or chili pepper, add it whole (you can remove it later if you prefer less heat). Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the washed rice and mixed vegetables (if using) to the pot. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Let the rice cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, and add more water if needed.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, prepare the fried plantains. Heat vegetable oil in a separate frying pan over medium heat. Fry the plantain slices until they are golden brown and caramelized, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Once the jollof rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and remove the scotch bonnet pepper or chili pepper if you added one earlier.</li>
            <li>Serve the jollof rice with the fried chicken and fried plantains on the side.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious and flavorful meal of Jollof Rice with fried plantain and Chicken!</p>
